## Playlists

Playlists will be soon expanded, due to high user request.

### Main playlist

Playlist includes all channels from the main package bundle of AZ LestueMedia except adult channels, which are prohibited by law in San Brusslav.

```
https://github.com/LesteTurmetie/a/z.m3u
```

And here is the version to copy to your player:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LestueTurmetie/a/main/z.m3u
```



## EPG

The playlists already contain links to all guides, so players with support the `x-tvg-url` tag should load it automatically. Otherwise, you can choose one of the guides featured in the [iptv-org/epg](https://github.com/iptv-org/epg) repository.

## Database

Most TV channel data is taken from the [iptv-org/database](https://github.com/iptv-org/database) repository or from [IPTV CAT](https://iptvcat.com).
Radio station streaming links are collected from [FM Stream](https://fmstream.org)
If you find any errors please open a new issue, by clicking [here](https://github.com/LestueTurmetie/a/issues).

## Legal

No video files are stored in this repository. The repository simply contains user-submitted links to publicly available video stream URLs, which to the best of our knowledge have been intentionally made publicly by the copyright holders. If any links in these playlists infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, they may be removed by sending a [pull request](https://github.com/LestueTurmetie/a/pulls), by opening an [issue](https://github.com/LestueTurmetie/iptv/issues/new) AND an inquiry email to [cobra@estates.ml](mailto:cobra@estates.ml). However, note that we have **no control** over the destination of the link, and just removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents from the web. Note that linking does not directly infringe copyright because no copy is made on the site providing the link, and thus this is **not** a valid reason to send a DMCA notice to GitHub. To remove this content from the web, you should contact the web host that's actually hosting the content (**not** GitHub, nor the maintainers of this repository).
